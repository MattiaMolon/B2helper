# B2helper
The idea behind it was to create a personal dictionary of words to learn in a foreign language. <br />
when the user doesn't know a word, he translates it and adds it to his personal vocabolary<br />
In the future the user can test if he remembers the words he saved.


## Progresses
Untill now I had the time to code only the translator.
